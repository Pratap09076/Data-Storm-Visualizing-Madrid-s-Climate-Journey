## Project Overview
This project analyzes historical weather data from Madrid (1997-2015) to uncover climate patterns and relationships between various weather parameters. Using Python's data science stack (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), we explore temperature trends, pressure-humidity correlations, rainfall patterns, and seasonal variations.

## Key Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data cleaning pipeline
- Statistical analysis of weather parameters
- Visualization of temperature distributions and trends
- Correlation analysis between pressure, temperature and humidity
- Comparison of weather patterns between rainy/non-rainy days
- Seasonal temperature analysis with statistical testing

## Dataset
The dataset was obtained from [Maven Analytics Data Playground](https://mavenanalytics.io/data-playground) and contains:
- Daily weather records from 1997-2015
- 23 parameters including temperature, humidity, pressure, wind, and weather events
- 6,912 observations after cleaning

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
